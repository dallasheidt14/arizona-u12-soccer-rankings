# üèÜ V5.3E Enhanced Soccer Rankings Engine - Deep Technical Analysis

## üìã **OVERVIEW**

Our V5.3E Enhanced ranking system is a sophisticated, multi-layered algorithm designed to accurately rank youth soccer teams across multiple age groups, genders, and states. The system handles complex scenarios including cross-age games, cross-state competition, and varying levels of competition.

## üßÆ **CORE ALGORITHM: V5.3E Enhanced Formula**

### **Primary Power Score Calculation**
```
Power_Score = (0.20 √ó Offense_Norm) + (0.20 √ó Defense_Norm) + (0.60 √ó SOS_Norm)
```

**Weight Distribution:**
- **20% Offense**: Goals scored per game (schedule independent)
- **20% Defense**: Goals allowed per game (schedule independent, inverted)
- **60% Strength of Schedule**: Most important factor - who you played matters most

### **Adjusted Power Score (Final Ranking)**
```
Power_Score_Adj = Power_Score √ó Games_Penalty
```

**Games Penalty Formula:**
```
Games_Penalty = ‚àö(Games_Played / 20)
```

## üìä **DATA FILTERING & WINDOWS**

### **Time Windows**
- **Primary Window**: 365 days (1 year)
- **Maximum Games**: 30 games per team
- **Tiered Performance Weighting**:
  - **Games 1-15 (Most Recent)**: 60% weight
  - **Games 16-25 (Middle)**: 30% weight
  - **Games 26-30 (Oldest)**: 10% weight
- **Inactivity Threshold**: 180 days = "Inactive" status

### **Game Filtering**
- **Age Group Filtering**: Primary age group + cross-age support
- **Master List Validation**: Only teams in master lists are ranked
- **Date Range**: Last 18 months of data loaded, 1 year used for rankings

## üéØ **STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE (SOS) CALCULATION**

### **Iterative SOS Algorithm**
The V5.3E Enhanced system uses a sophisticated iterative SOS calculation that:

1. **Initializes team strengths** using win percentages
2. **Iteratively refines** based on opponent performance
3. **Applies margin weighting** with caps for game results
4. **Includes cross-age multipliers** (+5% for older opponents)
5. **Normalizes across age groups** for fair comparison
6. **Converges to stable solution** (max 10 iterations, 0.01 threshold)

### **Margin Weighting with Caps**
```
if Result == 'W':
    weight = min(1.6, 1.0 + 0.1 √ó capped_diff)
elif Result == 'L':
    weight = max(0.4, 1.0 - 0.1 √ó abs(capped_diff))
else:  # Tie
    weight = 1.0
```

**Key Features:**
- **Goal Differential Cap**: ¬±6 goals per game maximum
- **Weight Caps**: 1.6 maximum, 0.4 minimum
- **Linear Scaling**: Predictable and stable

### **Cross-Age Multiplier**
```
if Opponent_Age_Group != Primary_Age_Group:
    opponent_strength *= 1.05  # +5% bonus for older opponents
```

### **SOS Normalization**
After convergence, SOS values are normalized across both age groups:
```
Œº, œÉ = sos_values.mean(), sos_values.std()
normalized_sos = (sos_value - Œº) / œÉ
```

**Benefits:**
- **Fair Comparison**: U10 and U11 opponents on same scale
- **Prevents Bias**: No age group advantage
- **Stable Rankings**: Consistent across different datasets

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **NORMALIZATION PROCESS**

### **Logistic Normalization (V5.3E Enhanced)**
The system now uses logistic normalization instead of min-max scaling for better distribution handling:

#### **Offense Normalization**
```
Œº_off, œÉ_off = offense.mean(), offense.std()
offense_norm = 1 / (1 + exp(-(offense - Œº_off) / (œÉ_off √ó 1.5)))
```

#### **Defense Normalization**
```
Œº_def, œÉ_def = defense.mean(), defense.std()
defense_norm = 1 / (1 + exp(-(defense - Œº_def) / (œÉ_def √ó 1.5)))
defense_norm = 1 - defense_norm  # Invert (lower is better)
```

#### **SOS Normalization**
```
Œº_sos, œÉ_sos = sos_score.mean(), sos_score.std()
sos_norm = 1 / (1 + exp(-(sos_score - Œº_sos) / (œÉ_sos √ó 1.5)))
```

### **Logistic vs Min-Max Advantages**
- **Preserves Distribution**: Maintains relative differences
- **Handles Outliers**: Less sensitive to extreme values
- **Smooth Scaling**: No hard boundaries
- **Better Spread**: Avoids ceiling compression effects

## üèÖ **TEAM STATUS CLASSIFICATION**

### **Status Categories**
- **Active**: 5+ games, recent activity (within 180 days)
- **Provisional**: <5 games played
- **Inactive**: No games in last 180 days

### **Status Impact**
- **Provisional teams**: Lower confidence due to small sample size
- **Inactive teams**: May be ranked but flagged for review
- **Active teams**: Full confidence in rankings

---

## üîÑ **CROSS-AGE GAME HANDLING**

### **Supported Cross-Age Scenarios**
- **U10 vs U11**: U10 teams can play U11 opponents
- **U11 vs U12**: U11 teams can play U12 opponents
- **U12 vs U13**: U12 teams can play U13 opponents

### **Cross-Age Logic**
1. **Primary Age Group**: Team's main age group (e.g., U10)
2. **Cross-Age Opponents**: Looked up in next age group master list
3. **SOS Calculation**: Cross-age opponents included in strength calculation
4. **Game Counting**: Cross-age games count toward total games played

### **Cross-Age Statistics**
- **Cross_Age_Games**: Number of games vs different age group
- **Cross_Age_Pct**: Percentage of total games that are cross-age
- **Cross_Age_Opponents**: Number of unique cross-age opponents

---

## üåç **CROSS-STATE GAME HANDLING**

### **State Detection**
