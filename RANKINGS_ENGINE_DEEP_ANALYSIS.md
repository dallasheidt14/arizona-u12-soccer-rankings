# üèÜ V5.3E Enhanced Soccer Rankings Engine - Deep Technical Analysis

## üìã **OVERVIEW**

Our V5.3E Enhanced ranking system is a sophisticated, multi-layered algorithm designed to accurately rank youth soccer teams across multiple age groups, genders, and states. The system handles complex scenarios including cross-age games, cross-state competition, and varying levels of competition.

## üßÆ **CORE ALGORITHM: V5.3E Enhanced Formula**

### **Primary Power Score Calculation**
```
Power_Score = (0.20 √ó Win_Pct_Norm) + (0.20 √ó Goal_Diff_Norm) + (0.60 √ó SOS_Norm)
```

**Weight Distribution:**
- **20% Win Percentage**: Basic performance metric
- **20% Goal Differential**: Offensive/defensive balance
- **60% Strength of Schedule**: Most important factor - who you played matters most

### **Adjusted Power Score (Final Ranking)**
```
Power_Score_Adj = Power_Score √ó Games_Penalty
```

**Games Penalty Formula:**
```
Games_Penalty = ‚àö(Games_Played / 20)
```

## üìä **DATA FILTERING & WINDOWS**

### **Time Windows**
- **Primary Window**: 365 days (1 year)
- **Maximum Games**: 30 games per team
- **Tiered Performance Weighting**:
  - **Games 1-15 (Most Recent)**: 60% weight
  - **Games 16-25 (Middle)**: 30% weight
  - **Games 26-30 (Oldest)**: 10% weight
- **Inactivity Threshold**: 180 days = "Inactive" status

### **Game Filtering**
- **Age Group Filtering**: Primary age group + cross-age support
- **Master List Validation**: Only teams in master lists are ranked
- **Date Range**: Last 18 months of data loaded, 1 year used for rankings

---

## üéØ **STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE (SOS) CALCULATION**

### **Core SOS Logic**
1. **Calculate opponent win percentages** for all teams in master lists
2. **Cross-age opponent handling**: U10 teams can play U11 opponents
3. **Unknown opponent default**: 0.35 strength (35% win rate)
4. **Average opponent strength** = Mean of all opponent win percentages

### **SOS Formula**
```
SOS_Score = Œ£(Opponent_Win_Pct) / Number_of_Opponents
```

**Special Cases:**
- **Unknown Opponents**: Default to 0.35 strength
- **Cross-Age Opponents**: Looked up in appropriate master list
- **Missing Data**: Handled gracefully with defaults

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **NORMALIZATION PROCESS**

### **Win Percentage Normalization**
```
Win_Pct_Norm = Team_Win_Pct / Max_Win_Pct_In_Dataset
```

### **Goal Differential Normalization**
```
Goal_Diff_Norm = (Team_Goal_Diff - Min_Goal_Diff) / (Max_Goal_Diff - Min_Goal_Diff)
```

### **SOS Normalization**
```
SOS_Norm = Team_SOS_Score / Max_SOS_Score_In_Dataset
```

---

## üèÖ **TEAM STATUS CLASSIFICATION**

### **Status Categories**
- **Active**: 5+ games, recent activity (within 180 days)
- **Provisional**: <5 games played
- **Inactive**: No games in last 180 days

### **Status Impact**
- **Provisional teams**: Lower confidence due to small sample size
- **Inactive teams**: May be ranked but flagged for review
- **Active teams**: Full confidence in rankings

---

## üîÑ **CROSS-AGE GAME HANDLING**

### **Supported Cross-Age Scenarios**
- **U10 vs U11**: U10 teams can play U11 opponents
- **U11 vs U12**: U11 teams can play U12 opponents
- **U12 vs U13**: U12 teams can play U13 opponents

### **Cross-Age Logic**
1. **Primary Age Group**: Team's main age group (e.g., U10)
2. **Cross-Age Opponents**: Looked up in next age group master list
3. **SOS Calculation**: Cross-age opponents included in strength calculation
4. **Game Counting**: Cross-age games count toward total games played

### **Cross-Age Statistics**
- **Cross_Age_Games**: Number of games vs different age group
- **Cross_Age_Pct**: Percentage of total games that are cross-age
- **Cross_Age_Opponents**: Number of unique cross-age opponents

---

## üåç **CROSS-STATE GAME HANDLING**

### **State Detection**
- **Team State**: Determined from master team list
- **Opponent State**: Looked up from master team list
- **Cross-State Games**: Games where teams are from different states

### **Cross-State Statistics**
- **Cross_State_Games**: Number of games vs different state teams
- **Cross_State_Pct**: Percentage of total games that are cross-state
- **Geographic Diversity**: Indicator of competition level

---

- **Games 26-30 (Oldest)**: 10% weight - Historical context
- **Weighted Average**: Combines all three tiers for comprehensive recent performance

### **Goal Statistics**
- **Goals_For**: Total goals scored
- **Goals_Against**: Total goals allowed
- **Goal_Differential**: Goals_For - Goals_Against
