# 🚀 **PHASE C IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - ELITE PRODUCTION SYSTEM**

## 🎉 **PHASE C FEATURES SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED!**

### **✅ WHAT WE'VE DELIVERED:**

**🛡️ Provisional Gating (Closed-Loop Detection):**
- ✅ **Rule v1**: Provisional if < 6 games OR < 3 unique cross-cluster opponents
- ✅ **Detailed reasons**: Shows specific criteria that triggered provisional status
- ✅ **Badge system**: Teams marked as "Provisional" with tooltip explanations
- ✅ **No hiding**: Provisional teams remain visible with clear status indicators

**⚙️ Admin Review UI:**
- ✅ **Team resolution review**: Approve/reject fuzzy matches with confidence scores
- ✅ **Alias management**: Add/remove team aliases with audit logging
- ✅ **Missing sources**: Queue new data sources for scraper adapter development
- ✅ **Audit trail**: Complete logging of all admin actions
- ✅ **Authentication**: Simple password protection (configurable for production)

**⚽ PK Handling (Polish):**
- ✅ **Regulation score ranking**: Uses regulation time scores for ranking calculations
- ✅ **PK annotation**: UI shows "Won on PKs" with regulation score details
- ✅ **Decider tracking**: Records whether game was decided by PKs or regulation
- ✅ **Ranking integrity**: PK wins treated as ties for ranking purposes

**📊 Daily Monitoring Fields:**
- ✅ **Expectation model status**: Calibration status, gamma, delta, sample count
- ✅ **Game activity**: New games, changed games, unresolved teams
- ✅ **Impact buckets**: Distribution of good/neutral/weak/no_data results
- ✅ **Anomaly detection**: Weekend no-games, calibration issues, inactive spikes
- ✅ **Slack integration**: Formatted messages ready for webhook delivery

**🧪 Validation Tests:**
- ✅ **Expectation centering**: Mean expected GD ≈ 0 when calibrated
- ✅ **No data handling**: Proper NaN handling for missing team stats
- ✅ **Window filtering**: ≤20 games within last 365 days
- ✅ **Impact distribution**: No extreme skew in bucket percentages
- ✅ **Correlation validation**: Positive correlation between expected and actual GD
