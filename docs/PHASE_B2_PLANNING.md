# Phase B2: Poisson Hybrid Upgrade Planning

## 🎯 Overview

Phase B2 represents the next major evolution of the ranking system, transitioning from the current Elo-based iterative SOS to a sophisticated Poisson-based expected-goals model that decomposes team strength into separate offensive and defensive components.

## 🧠 Conceptual Framework

### Current State (Phase B1 - Iterative SOS)
- **Single Rating**: Each team has one Elo rating
- **Goal Differential**: Uses actual goal differences for updates
- **Network Effect**: Performance propagates through opponent network

### Target State (Phase B2 - Poisson Hybrid)
- **Dual Components**: Separate offensive and defensive ratings per team
- **Expected Goals**: Poisson-based goal expectation modeling
- **Attack/Defense Decomposition**: Teams rated on both scoring ability and defensive strength

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Poisson Goal Modeling
```python
# Expected goals based on team offensive/defensive strengths
def expected_goals(team_off_strength, opp_def_strength):
    return poisson.pmf(goals, team_off_strength * opp_def_strength)
```

#### 2. Dual Rating System
```python
# Separate ratings for offense and defense
team_ratings = {
    'offensive': 1500,    # Scoring ability
    'defensive': 1500     # Defensive strength
}
```

#### 3. Iterative Updates
```python
# Update both components based on actual vs expected goals
def update_ratings(team_off, team_def, opp_off, opp_def, actual_goals_for, actual_goals_against):
    expected_for = poisson_expectation(team_off, opp_def)
    expected_against = poisson_expectation(opp_off, team_def)
    
    # Update offensive rating based on goals scored
    team_off += k_factor * (actual_goals_for - expected_for)
    
    # Update defensive rating based on goals conceded
    team_def += k_factor * (expected_against - actual_goals_against)
```

## 📊 Expected Improvements

| Metric | Current (Elo) | Target (Poisson) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Goal Prediction Accuracy** | ~60% | ~75% | +15% |
| **Attack/Defense Separation** | None | High | New capability |
| **Expected Goals Modeling** | Basic | Sophisticated | Major upgrade |
