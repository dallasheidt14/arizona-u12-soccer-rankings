# Rankings v5 Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented the **tapered recency window** algorithm (v5) with a 30-game cap and linear decay for games 26-30. This improves fairness and stability for teams with high game volumes while maintaining mathematical rigor.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Core Algorithm (rankings/generate_team_rankings_v5.py)**
- ✅ 30-game maximum cap (up from 20)
- ✅ Linear taper for games 26-30 (0.8 → 0.4 multipliers)
- ✅ Deterministic 70/30 segment weights (last 10 games get 70% weight)
- ✅ Min-max normalization for offense and defense
- ✅ Multiplicative GP penalties (0.75×, 0.90×, 1.00×)
- ✅ Inactivity filtering (6 months)
- ✅ Defense mapping: `1 / (1 + GA_per_game)`

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
- ✅ `MAX_GAMES_FOR_RANK=30`
- ✅ `FULL_WEIGHT_GAMES=25` 
- ✅ `DAMPEN_START=25`
- ✅ `DAMPEN_END=30`
- ✅ `DAMPEN_FACTOR=0.8`
- ✅ `TAPER_ENABLED=true`
- ✅ `RECENT_K=10`
- ✅ `RECENT_SHARE=0.70`
- ✅ All configurable via environment variables

### 3. **API Updates (app.py)**
- ✅ File preference order: v5 → v4 → v3 → legacy
- ✅ Enhanced meta response with method legend
- ✅ Meta includes: slice info, record counts, hidden_inactive, method description
- ✅ Method legend: "Up to 30 most-recent matches (last 12 months). Games 26–30 count with reduced influence."

### 4. **Comprehensive Testing (test_tapered_weights.py)**
- ✅ **5/5 tests passing**
- ✅ Segment weights validation (70/30 split)
- ✅ Tapered weights validation (linear decay)
- ✅ Weight properties (normalization, monotonicity)
- ✅ Algorithm stability
- ✅ Comparison framework (ready for v4 vs v5)

### 5. **Generated Files**
- ✅ `Rankings_v5.csv` (151 teams, AZ Boys 2014)
- ✅ Environment templates: `env.staging.template`, `env.prod.template`
- ✅ Test suite: `test_tapered_weights.py`
- ✅ Frontend integration example: `frontend_integration_example.jsx`

## 📊 Algorithm Details

### Tapered Weights Formula

For a team with `n` games:

```python
if n <= 25:
    # Use base 70/30 segment weights
    weights = segment_weights(n, recent_k=10, recent_share=0.70)

elif 25 < n <= 30:
    # Apply linear taper for games 26-30
    base_weights = segment_weights(25, recent_k=10, recent_share=0.70)
    
    # Linear multipliers: 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4
    extra_games = n - 25
    multipliers = linspace(0.8, 0.4, extra_games)
    tapered_weights = base_weights[-1] * multipliers
    
    weights = concatenate([base_weights, tapered_weights])
    
else:  # n > 30
    # Ignore games beyond 30
    recent_30 = most_recent_30_games
    # Apply taper logic to these 30 games
```

### Weight Distribution Examples

**n=20 games:**
- Last 10 games: 70% total weight (7% each)
- First 10 games: 30% total weight (3% each)

**n=30 games:**
- Games 1-15: 30% total weight distributed
- Games 16-25: 70% base weight distributed  
- Game 26: 0.8× last base weight
- Game 27: 0.7× last base weight
- Game 28: 0.6× last base weight
- Game 29: 0.5× last base weight
- Game 30: 0.4× last base weight
- **Tapered influence (26-30): ~17.4% total**

**n=35 games:**
- Games 1-5: Ignored (weight = 0)
- Games 6-35: Same as n=30 logic applied to most recent 30

## 📈 Impact Analysis

### v5 vs v4 Rankings (Top 10)

| Rank | Team | v4 PS_adj | v5 PS_adj | GP | Change |
|------|------|-----------|-----------|-----|--------|
| 1 | PFC Danger B2014 Blue | 0.690 | 0.742 | 1 | +0.052 (provisional) |
| 2 | FC Elite Arizona 2014 Boys - Martinez | 0.662 | 0.684 | 6 | +0.022 |
| 3 | Phoenix United 2014 Premier | 0.688 | 0.650 | 30 | -0.038 |
| 4 | 2014 Elite | 0.611 | 0.647 | 10 | +0.036 |
| 5 | PRFC Scottsdale 14B Pre-Academy | 0.661 | 0.619 | 30 | -0.042 |

**Key Observations:**
- Teams with 25-30 games see slight score adjustments
- Overall rankings remain stable (top teams still top)
- High-volume teams (30 games) get appropriate credit
- Low-volume teams (1-10 games) still have appropriate penalties

## 🎯 Why v5 Is Better

### 1. **More Representative**
- 30 games capture more data for high-activity teams
- Full tournament seasons + league play

### 2. **Reduced Volatility**
- Tapered influence reduces impact of outlier games
- One fluke win/loss matters less

### 3. **Fair to All Volume Levels**
- Teams < 25 games: Use all their data
- Teams 25-30 games: Get appropriate credit with taper
- Teams > 30 games: Most recent 30 used

### 4. **Mathematically Sound**
- Linear decay is explainable and intuitive
- Weights always normalize to 1.0
- Monotonic decrease in influence

### 5. **Configurable**
- All parameters tunable via environment
- Can experiment without code changes
- Easy rollback if needed
