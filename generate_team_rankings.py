AZ U12 Team Ranking System - Backend
====================================

Complete backend script to calculate offensive, defensive, and SOS ratings
with weighted recent game emphasis and game count penalties.

Features:
- Weighted offensive/defensive stats (last 10 games weighted more heavily)
- Strength of Schedule (SOS) calculations
- Game count penalties for teams with fewer games
- Power Score rankings with metadata
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
