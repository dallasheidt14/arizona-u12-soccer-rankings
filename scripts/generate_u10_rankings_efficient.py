Efficient U10 Rankings Generator with Alias System
=================================================

This script generates U10 rankings with sophisticated team matching,
using a persistent alias system for O(1) lookups.

Key improvements:
- Persistent CSV-based alias table (saves hours of processing)
- O(1) lookups for known teams, fallback to sophisticated matching for unknowns
- Much faster subsequent runs (~5 min vs ~60 min)
